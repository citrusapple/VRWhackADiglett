# VRWhackADiglett
 Whack a Diglett in an arcade room modeled after Stranger Things arcade set, surrounded by models of 80's arcade games.

This is my first attempt on creating a virtual reality game.  Downloading the .apk file on an android device and use Google Cardboard to 
whack some digletts on their heads with a pokeball.

All 3D model assets are original work created on Blender. This game was developed with C# scripts with the Unity Engine following a tutorial on an <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/build-30-mini-virtual-reality-games-in-unity-3d-from-scratch/" target ="_blank">Udemy course</a> with some deviation.

Here is a render of the game enviornment.
